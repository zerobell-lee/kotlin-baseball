# Let's study Kotlin

## Description

This repository is made for studying Kotlin.
When I want to know new languages, I usually re-code old projects with the new language. I cannot assure this way is the best way to learn new languages, however at least, I feel this way is the funniest way to learn new languages, without experiencing boring tasks such as reading basic documentations.

> It does not mean that documentations never count on, I can focus on learning by not only reading, but also doing by myself.

### 1. baseball

Reference : [Bulls And Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)

> This game is known as "Numeric Baseball Game(숫자 야구 게임)" in Korea, so that I was confused when I searched **"Numeric Baseball Game"**, and could not find any English references about this game.

**"Bulls And Cows"** can be the good project for newbie programmers since this project contains such as generating random numbers, handling stdin/stdout, comparing arrays, and so on.
