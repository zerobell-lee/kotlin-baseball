# Let's study Kotlin

## Description

This repository is made for studying Kotlin.
When I want to know new languages, I usually re-code old projects with the new language. I cannot assure this way is the best way to learn new languages, however at least, I feel this way is the funniest way to learn new languages, without experiencing boring tasks such as reading basic documentations.

> It does not mean that documentations never count on, I can focus on learning by not only reading, but also doing by myself.

## Index

### 1. baseball

Reference : [Bulls And Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)

> This game is known as "Numeric Baseball Game(숫자 야구 게임)" in Korea, so that I was confused when I searched **"Numeric Baseball Game"**, and could not find any English references about this game.

**"Bulls And Cows"** can be the good project for newbie programmers since this project contains such as generating random numbers, handling stdin/stdout, comparing arrays, and so on.

### 2. string.palindrome

Reference : [Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)   

> A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar. (from Wikipedia)

This project check whether the input string is actually palindrome or not. It does not distinguish upper cases and lower cases, and checks only alphabets and numbers.

### 3. string.anagram

Reference : [Anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)

> An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. (from Wikipedia)

This project receives two strings, and check whether they are in anagrams or not. It does not care cases.

### 4. string.caesar

Reference : [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

> One day, I gave this programming quiz to my friend, who is a newbie programmer. He said "Well, I'll do my best."
>
>At the end of the day, he said to me, "Now I see why he was murdered by Brutus. I want to kill him also."

**"Caesar Cipher"** can be a good project for newbies since it teaches us how to handle characters as numbers.

This project encrypt the plaintext that you input with the key.
